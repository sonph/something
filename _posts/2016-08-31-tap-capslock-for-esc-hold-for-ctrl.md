Today I stumbled upon a post by Brendon Rapp on economyofeffort.com titled "_Beyond Ctrl: Make That Caps Lock Key Useful_".

> tl;dr: Supercharge your Caps Lock key by making it Esc when tapped, and Ctrl when held.

Read that again. __CapsLock key acts as Esc when tapped, Ctrl when held down__?

_Mind = blown_ ðŸ˜±ðŸ’¥ðŸ˜µ _, amirite?_

I have never used the CapsLock key as I've always held the Shift key to type in UPPERCASE, and as a Vim user most of the time I have CapsLock mapped to Ctrl via macOS' System Preferences. This way my pinky doesn't have to awkwardly reach for the Ctrl key at the corner of the keyboard, which I do hundreds of times a day.

Yes yes, I know you can alternatively press `Ctrl-C` instead of Esc, but having Esc right under your pinky, system wide? Totally cool stuffsðŸ‘Œ!

Another reason for my excitement is that I'm using the Pok3r RGB keyboard, which combines the grave (<code>`</code>) key with the Esc key under one keycap. This means that I can't have the keyboard configured in anyway that makes pressing both of them in one keystroke each.

Anyway, the [post][1] has instructions for setting this up under both macOS and Linux. Go and check it out!

In case the post ever goes away, here's how you do it on macOS:

1. Install [Karabiner][2] and [Seil][3]:

    ```
    brew tap caskroom/cask && brew cask install karabiner seil
    ```

2. Go to _System Preferences > Keyboard > Modifier Keys_ and set _CapsLock_ as _No Action_.
3. Open the _Seil_ app and under _Change the caps lock key_, set the keycode to _80_.
4. Open the _Karabiner_ app. Go to _System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Accessibility_ and allow _Karabiner__AXNotifier_. In the _Karabiner_ app, search for and enable _F19 to Escape and Control_.
