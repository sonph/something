title: Tap CapsLock for Esc, hold for Ctrl

Today I stumbled upon a post by Brendon Rapp on economyofeffort.com titled "_Beyond Ctrl: Make That Caps Lock Key Useful_".

> tl;dr: Supercharge your Caps Lock key by making it Esc when tapped, and Ctrl when held.

Read that again. _CapsLock key acts as Esc when tapped, Ctrl when held down_?

_Mind = blown_ ðŸ˜±ðŸ’¥ðŸ˜µ _, right?_

If it isn't immediately obvious to you, pressing `CapsLock-C` sends `Ctrl-C`, while tapping `CapsLock` by itself sends an `Esc`.

## Why it's amazing

I never use the `CapsLock` key to type in UPPERCASE, so I always have it mapped to `Ctrl` via macOS' System Preferences. This way my pinky doesn't have to awkwardly reach for the `Ctrl` key at the corner of the keyboard, which I do hundreds of times a day (especially in the terminal and Vim).

Yes yes, I know you can alternatively press `Ctrl-C` instead of `Esc` in Vim, but having `Esc` right under your pinky, system wide? Totally cool stuffsðŸ‘Œ!

Another reason for my excitement is that I'm using the [Pok3r RGB](https://www.instagram.com/p/BJMSxxxBUW4/?taken-by=_sonph) 60% keyboard, which combines the grave (<code>`</code>) key with `Esc` under the same keycap. This means that I can't have the keyboard configured in anyway that makes it possible to press either in one keystroke each.

## How to caps

The [post][1] has instructions for setting this up on both macOS and Linux (sorry Windows users!). Go check it out!

In case the post ever goes away, here's how you do it on macOS:

1. Install [Karabiner][2] and [Seil][3]:

    ```
    brew tap caskroom/cask && brew cask install karabiner seil
    ```

2. Go to _System Preferences > Keyboard > Modifier Keys_ and set _CapsLock_ as _No Action_.
3. Open the _Seil_ app and under _Change the caps lock key_, set the keycode to _80_.
4. Open the _Karabiner_ app. Go to _System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Accessibility_ and allow _Karabiner__AXNotifier_. In the _Karabiner_ app, search for and enable _F19 to Escape and Control_.
