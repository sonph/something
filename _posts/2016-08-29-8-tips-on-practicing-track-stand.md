I just learned how to track stand on my fixed gear over the weekend and have these 8 tips to help you practice this one ~~weird~~ cool trick! ðŸš´ âš– ðŸ˜† ðŸ™Œ ðŸ‘Œ

1. Understand that just like any other balance trick, it's important to first _find your balance sweet spot_ and then simply try to keep it. The less you deviate from this center point the less work you'll have to do to maintain it.

2. Let it sink in. There are _three things_ to track standing:
  - Find your balance sweet spot
  - Pedal forward
  - Pedal backward (this needs some getting used to)

3. When we try to pedal very slowly, we tend to turn the front wheel to one side to another. While track standing though, we'll want to _pedal backward_ instead of turning the wheel to the other side.

4. Get used to the backward motion by starting with one foot on the back pedal and the other on the ground, then push back with both feet while turning to one side. You likely won't be able to put both feet on the pedals and complete a circle, but it helps getting used to this motion.

5. Turn the front wheel _about 50 - 75 degrees to the side of your front foot_.

6. If you feel like you're falling forward, put pressure on the front pedal. Likewise if you're falling backward, put pressure on the back pedal instead of turning the front wheel to the other side.

7. It helps to have some chain slack so there is a "dead zone" and the bike doesn't move with every movement of the pedals.

8. Initially practice standing up so you can rock your body side to side for more control.

That's it guys! Now I'm off to practice no handed track stand! ðŸš´ ðŸ’¨
