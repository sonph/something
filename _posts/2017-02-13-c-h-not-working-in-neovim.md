If you have `<C-h>` mapped in NeoVim to something such as `<C-w>h` to enable quick pane switching and it's not working, here's how you fix it.

Note that this fix is for neovim running in iTerm on macOS.

## The Issue

`<C-j>`, `<C-k>`, `<C-l>` mappings all work, except for `<C-h>`. It seems to be interpreted as `<BS>` (_backspace_, not _bu.*t_). By the way, if you do not know, `<C-h>` is historically selected because [`H` is the eighth character in the alphabet, and `<BS>` is ASCII code `08`][3].

## The Fix

You'll need to configure iTerm to send the correct [CSI][2] code for `<C-h>`:
1. In iTerm go to __Edit__ > __Preferences__ (or `âŒ˜,`) > __Keys__
2. Click `+` to add an entry
3. Press `Ctrl - h` in the __Keyboard Shortcut__ box
4. Choose __Send Escape Sequence__ as the __Action__
5. Type `[104;5u` as the __Esc+__ code

This key mapping will be applied to all your iTerm profiles.
