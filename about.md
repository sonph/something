Yo! Hello!

Welcome to my little corner on the vast, vast Internet! Glad you stopped by.

My name is _Son A. Pham_, aka _Sonny Pham_. I'm currently a Software Engineer
at [Google](https://google.com), in Mountain View, California. I started in 2016
and am currently working on internal infrastructure and tools for a product
within [Google Apps](https://apps.google.com/).

Before that I went to [University of Texas at Dallas](http://utdallas.edu)
(_woosh_), grabbed a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science. During the time
there I also interned at [Compumatrice](http://compumatrice.com),
[Intuit](https://intuit.com) and [AT&T](https://att.com), doing Android
development, infrastructure/tools and big data, respectively.

I like building [things with code](https://github.com/sonph), all kinds of
music, electric guitars, fixed gear bikes, video games, asian food, chipotle,
etc.

Within the technology space, I'm interested in open source, machine learning and
artificial intelligence, cloud computing, web development, UI/UX design and
entrepreneurship.

For comments or questions, feel free to send them my way using any of the
external links in the menu, or via email to `sp#thisdomain.me`!


## ...The Site

This site serves as my personal homepage, portfolio and technology-focused
blog/ramblings (though admittedly I'm not too good at writing anything except
for maybe `code`).

It was developed with Jekyll, Pug (formerly Jade), Font Awesome, Sass,
and hosted with GitHub Pages. Did I mention the
[source code](https://github.com/sonph/sonph.github.io) is available on GitHub?

Before this site I developed two other iterations (one totally from scratch and
one with bloated frameworks and hero images), only to be deprecated a couple of
months later.

By the way, I also have an Atom feed (think RSS) setup for the site
(`http://sonpham.me/feed.xml`), so why don't you add it to your favorite news
reader and receive my latest posts? ðŸ˜‰
