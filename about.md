Hello world!

Welcome to my little corner on the vast, vast Internet! Glad you stopped by.

My name is **Son A. Pham**, aka **Sonny Pham**. I'm currently a Software Engineer at
[Google](https://google.com), in <s>Mountain View</s> Sunnyvale, California. I started in 2016 and am currently
working on internal infrastructure and tooling for products within
[Google Apps](https://apps.google.com/).

Before that I went to [University of Texas at Dallas](http://utdallas.edu) (woosh), earned a
Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science. During the time there I also interned at
[Compumatrice](http://compumatrice.com), [Intuit](https://intuit.com) and [AT&T](https://att.com),
doing Android development, infrastructure/tools and big data, respectively.

I like building things with code, all kinds of music, electric guitars, cars (JDM FTW), fixed gear
bikes, video games, asian food, chipotle, etc.

Within the technology space, I'm interested in open source, machine learning and AI, distributed
cloud computing, web development, UI/UX design, cryptocurrencies and entrepreneurship.

For comments or questions, feel free to send them my way using any of the external links in the
menu, or via email to `sp#thisdomain.me`!


## \...The Site

This site serves as my personal homepage, portfolio and technology-focused blog/ramblings (though
admittedly I'm not too good at writing anything except for maybe some `code`).

It is developed using Jekyll, Pug (formerly Jade), Font Awesome, Sass, and hosted with GitHub Pages.
Did I mention the [source code](https://github.com/sonph/sonph.github.io) is available on GitHub?

Before this site I developed two other iterations (one totally from scratch without using any
frameworks and one with bloated frameworks and hero images), only to be deprecated a couple of
months later.

By the way, I also have an Atom feed (think RSS) setup for the site (`http://sonpham.me/feed.xml`),
so why don't you add it to your favorite news reader and receive my latest posts? ðŸ˜‰
